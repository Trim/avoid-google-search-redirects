When a user hover a Google Search result, target link seems to be the right one, but, when user click on this link, the target is rewritten with a Google tracker to save your click on Google Search engine.  To achieve this, Google Search results uses an onmousedown event which calls a  rewrite of target link with a function called « rwt ».  This extensions simply redefine this rwt function with an empty function, so nothing happens on click and user go directly to its result.  This is a fork of « Remove Google Redirect in Google Search Results » rewritten as WebExtension with advises given in user comments."
